          Results
        </h3>

        <p>
          Results from the survey indicate Hillary Clinton will win the town with a slight majority of votes (53% compared to Donald Trump's 40%).
        </p>

        <p>
          While each candidate earns around 90% support from their respective parties, Trump wins the Independent vote by a narrow majority (51% to Clinton's 40%).
        </p>
        <img src="../images/potus-2016/weighted-2016-by-party.png" alt="" style="margin-bottom:2em; padding:1.5em; border:1px solid #000;"/>

        <p>
          The race is tight within most age groups, but Trump underperforms with voters under 38 years of age. The widest margin of Clinton support comes within the youngest age group (voters under 28 years of age).
        </p>
        <img src="../images/potus-2016/weighted-2016-by-age.png" alt="" style="margin-bottom:2em; padding:1.5em; border:1px solid #000;"/>




        <p>
          Clinton draws almost no support from Romney 2012 voters, while Trump draws one third of his support from Obama 2012 voters.
          Trump receives more support from voters who did not vote in 2012 than does Clinton.

        <!--p>
          Self-reported support for Clinton in 2016 underperforms self-reported support for Obama in 2012.

          Methodology Notes
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>A public-record list of registered voters was obtained from the <a href="https://www.branford-ct.gov/Voter">Branford Registrar of Voters</a> on October 21, 2016.</li>
          <li>A survey population was compiled from the list of <code>Active</code> registered voters who had produced a valid form of identification.</li>
          <li>A stratified random survey sample was chosen across <code>Party</code> and <code>Age</code> demographics. The sample excluded voters who did not list a phone number and voters who listed the same phone number as another voter.</li>
          <li>The survey was conducted via SMS on the evening of November 2, 2016. Responses were accepted until midnight concluding November 3, 2016.</li>
          <li>Respondents who indicated they were not "likely to vote" were screened-out.</li>
          <li>Only complete responses were analyzed and included in the final results.</li>
          <li>Based on the voter population size (18,642) and number of complete responses (176), the margin of error is &plusmn; 7.35%.</li>
          <li>A significantly-higher proportion of younger voters completed the survey relative to their share of the overall population.</li>
          <li>A slightly-higher proportion of party-affiliated voters completed the survey relative to their share of the overall population.</li>

          <li>Responses were weighted by <code>Party</code> and <code>Age</code> demographics<!-- , then by <code>2012 Vote</code> response --> before being analyzed and compiled into final results.</li>
        </ol>
